# How to Solve LeetCode and Similar Problems

This guide outlines the key steps and mindset for approaching and solving problems on platforms like LeetCode. It is primarily focused on **easy** and **medium** problems.

## Problem-Solving Process

1. **Identify the Problem Type**

   - Determine which **algorithm** or **data structure** the problem expects.
   - Problems often disguise the algorithm using real-world analogies (e.g., cities, networks, brackets).

2. **Implement the Algorithm**

   - Directly translate the algorithm to code.
   - Feed the given input into the algorithm and solve.

3. **(For Hard Problems) Modify Algorithms**
   - Apply tweaks or combine multiple algorithms to solve more complex problems.
   - Example: Combining BFS and backtracking.

## Recognizing Problem Patterns

- **Pattern Matching**: Problems often use everyday concepts to hide their underlying algorithm:
  - Example 1: "Find the shortest route between cities" → **Graph Problem (BFS)**.
  - Example 2: "Check if brackets are balanced" → **Stack Problem**.

### Key Tip:

Solve problems **tagged** with specific algorithms or data structures to get familiar with these patterns.

## How to Get Good at LeetCode

1. **Study Common Algorithms and Data Structures**

   - Examples: BFS, DFS, two-pointer technique, dynamic programming, heaps, stacks, etc.

2. **Practice Implementation**

   - Write and reimplement these algorithms many times.

3. **Solve Tagged Problems**
   - Focus on problems tagged with the algorithms/data structures you’ve studied.
   - Build familiarity by solving these repeatedly.

## Building Problem-Solving Intuition

- The more problems you solve, the better you’ll get at recognizing patterns.
- Start with easy and medium problems. Hard problems require additional experience.

## Example Keywords to Identify Algorithms

| Real-World Problem Description                 | Likely Algorithm or Data Structure |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Find shortest route between cities             | BFS / Graph                        |
| Check for valid expressions with brackets      | Stack                              |
| Find the maximum subarray sum                  | Sliding Window                     |
| Group similar items based on common properties | HashMap or Union-Find              |

### Summary:

- Focus on learning **common patterns** in problems.
- Solve **tagged problems** to practice and reinforce your knowledge.
- Over time, patterns will become intuitive, making easy and medium problems straightforward.
