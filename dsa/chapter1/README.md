# Data Structures and Algorithms

A data structure is the organization of data to reduce storage space usage and simplify tasks. Data structures are crucial for handling large amounts of data in various fields, such as database management and internet indexing services.

In this chapter, we will focus on the definition of abstract data types and classify data structures into several categories:

- **Linear**
- **Nonlinear**
- **Homogeneous**
- **Heterogeneous**
- **Dynamic types**

Abstract data types such as `Container`, `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Graph`, `Stack`, and `Queue` are presented in this chapter. We will also cover performance analysis of data structures, choosing the right data structures, and structural design patterns.

Readers will learn how to start writing basic algorithms using the appropriate data structures in Go. The first step in solving a problem is selecting the suitable data structure and algorithms. Next, performance analysis, including time and space complexity, is crucial for comparing algorithms and choosing the optimal one.

**Prerequisite:** Basic knowledge of Go.
